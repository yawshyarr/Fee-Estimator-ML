# Fee-Estimator-ML
Forecasting Fees 
This project predicts future college fees using LINEAR REGRESSION in python. It takes past fee data ( I have taken 2021 - 2025 ) , trains regression models for each fee component , and forecasts upcoming years ( 2026 - 2027 ) 
Along with predictions , the project also provides visualizations like line graphs , regression trends , and stacked bar charts to show how each fee component contributes to the total
